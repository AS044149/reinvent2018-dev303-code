# Prerequisites

To simplify the initial setup this workshop recommends to use AWS Cloud9. The following instructions will guide you through the setup of Cloud9. If you like you can install the required tooling on your local machine and will still be able to accomplish the whole workshop.

## Log in to your AWS account
> Your account must have the ability to create new IAM roles and scope other IAM permissions.

Once you have logged in to your AWS account, ensure you are following the remaining workshop steps
as **IAM user** with **Administrator** access to the AWS account.

## Cloud9 Setup - **Recommended**

Follow the [Cloud9 setup](cloud9-mode.md) instructions to complete the Labs.

### Manual Setup - *Expert*

If you are comfortable installing tooling onto your local machine follow the [Manual Mode](manual-mode.md) instructions.
